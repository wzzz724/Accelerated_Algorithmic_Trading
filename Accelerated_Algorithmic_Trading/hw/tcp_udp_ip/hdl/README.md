# HDL Directory
This HDL directory exists as a workaround from the export_simulation Vivado command.
It is intended that this directory will be removed once the Vivado command is able to generate the correct +incdir+ paths for Questa.
However, this directory provides the source files that are required for a few IP blocks.
These files are part of the core IP blocks so care should be taken to ensure that they do not go out of date in the interim.
